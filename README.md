# SHV Client library for Rust

This is a library implementing client functionality with device capabilities
according to [SHV specification](https://silicon-heaven.github.io/shv-doc/index.html).

It is currently unstable, going through a heavy development and architecture changes.

## Origin

The project originated in an early development stage of [SHV for Rust](https://github.com/silicon-heaven/shv-rs/), from
the device example at rev. e740fd301dc65f3412ad1154595bf61ee5632aba. It is being developed as a separate project having
shv-rs as a dependency.
